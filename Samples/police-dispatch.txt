And the noise is coming from the apartment directly above yours, Apartment 3B? Caller: Yes, that’s right. Dispatcher: Understood. Are you able to tell if there are any signs of a disturbance besides loud music—yelling, banging, anything like that? Caller: I don’t hear yelling, just really loud bass that’s shaking the walls. Dispatcher: All right. Officers will be dispatched to check on the situation. If anything escalates or you feel unsafe, call us back immediately. Caller: Okay. Thank you. Dispatcher: You’re welcome. Officers are en route.
